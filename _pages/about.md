Hi! I am Yuchen Li, a 1st-year master student major in computer science at [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en). I'm now living in Hefei, China with my lovely family. I am working as a researcher at the Visual Computing Center at KAUST, advised by Prof. [Mohamed Elhoseiny](http://www.mohamed-elhoseiny.com/). Before joining in KAUST, I graduated from [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/). I worked with Processor Xiaoying Tang at SUSTech and mainly focus on the research about the AI-based early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders and eye diseases. I am proud to be an open-source contributor and I want to make friends with friends all over the world! In 2019, I finished my research project in Tsinghua University and did open source program on [Apache RocketMQ](http://rocketmq.apache.org/) as the student developer of Alibaba Summer of Code.
